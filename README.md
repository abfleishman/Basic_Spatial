Basic Spatial (bird Tracking) data analysis in R

I have been making short example scripts when people ask me for code to be used for basic spatial analysis in R.  Currently there are scripts for:
- extracting contours from Bathymatry from `marmap` 
- extracting environmental remote sensed vars (from a local raster) along a track
- basic maps of kernel density (utilization distribution)
- segmenting tracks into seperate trips based on distance from colony
- raster map with mean value of a var in each cell (eg for making isoscape)
- basic GLS (geolocator) processing with `probGLS`
